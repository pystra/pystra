Structural Reliability
======================


Structural reliability analysis (SRA) is an important part to handle
structural engineering applications. This section provides a brief
introduction to this topic and is also the theoretical background for the
Python library, Python Structural Reliability Analysis (`Pystra`).

Limit States
------------
The word structural reliability refers to the meaning "how
much reliable is a structure in terms of fulfilling its
purpose" [Malioka2009]_. The performance of structures and engineering
systems was based on deterministic parameters even for a long time, even if it
was known that all stages of the system involve uncertainties. SRA provides a
method to take those uncertainties into account in a consistent manner. In
this content the term probability of failure is more common than
reliability. [Malioka2009]_

In general, the term "failure" is a vague definition because it means
different things in different cases. For this purpose the concept of limit
state is used to define failure in the context of SRA. [Nowak2000]_

.. note::

   A limit state represents a boundary between desired and undesired
   performance of a structure.

This boundary is usually interpreted and formulated within a mathematical
model for the functionality and performance of a structural system, and
expressed by a limit state function. [Ditlevsen2007]_

.. note::
   [Limit State Function]

   Let :math:`{\bf X}` describe a set of random variables :math:`{X}_1
   \dots {X}_n` which influence the performance of a structure. Then the
   functionality of the structure is called limit state function, denoted by
   :math:`g` and given by

   .. math::
      :label: eq:2_69

              g({\bf X})=g(X_1,\dots,X_n)

The boundary between desired and undesired performance would be given when
:math:`g({\bf X}) = 0`. If :math:`g({\bf X}) > 0`, it implies a desired
performance and the structure is safe. An undesired performance is given by
:math:`g({\bf X}) \leq 0` and it implies an unsafe structure or failure of the
system. [Baker2010]_

The probability of failure :math:`p_f` is equal to the probability that an
undesired performance will occur. It can be mathematical expressed as

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_70

           p_f = P(g({\bf X})\leq 0) = \iiint\limits_{g({\bf X})\leq 0} f_{{\bf
           X}}({\bf x}) d {\bf x}

assuming that all random variables :math:`{\bf X}` are continuous. However,
there are three major issues related to the Equation :eq:`eq:2_70`, proposed
by [Baker2010]_:

   1. There is not always enough information to define the complete joint
      probability density function :math:`f_X({\bf x})`.
   2. The limit state function :math:`g({\bf X})` may be difficult to evaluate.
   3. Even if :math:`f_X({\bf x})` and :math:`g({\bf X})` are known, numerical
      computing of high dimensional integrals is difficult.

For this reason various methods have been developed to overcome these chal-
lenges. The most common ones are the Monte Carlo simulation method and the
First Order Reliability Method (FORM).

The Classical Approach
----------------------

Before discussing more general methods, the principles are shown on a
"historical" and simplified limit state function.

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_71

           g(R,S) = R - S

Where :math:`R` is a random variable for the resistance with the outcome
:math:`r` and :math:`S` represents a random variable for the internal strength
or stress with the outcome of :math:`s`. [Lemaire2010]_ The probability of
failure is according to Equation :eq:`eq:2_70`:

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_72

           p_f = P(R-S \leq 0) = \iint\limits_{r\leq s} f_{R,S}(r,s) d r d s

If :math:`R` and :math:`S` are independent the Equation :eq:`eq:2_72` can be
rewritten as a convolution integral, where the probability of failure
:math:`p_f` can be (numerical) computed. [Schneider2007]_

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_73

             p_f = P(R-S \leq 0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F_R(x) f_{S}(x) d x

.. figure:: images/f-02-07-a.*
   :alt: Classical Approach R − S.
   :align: center
   :scale: 50

If :math:`R` and :math:`S` are independent and :math:`R \sim N (\mu_R ,
\sigma_R )` as well as :math:`S \sim N (\mu_S , \sigma_S )` are
normally distributed, the convolution integral :eq:`eq:2_73` can be evaluated
analytically.

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_74

           M = R - S

where :math:`M` is the safety margin and also normal distributed :math:`M \sim N
(\mu_M , \sigma_M )` with the parameters

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_75

           \mu_M = \mu_R-\mu_S

.. math::
  :label: eq:2_76

          \sigma_M = \sqrt{\sigma_R^2+\sigma_S^2}

The probability of failure :math:`p_f` can be determined by the use of the
standard normal distribution function.

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_77

           p_f = \Phi\left(\frac{0-\mu_m}{\sigma_M}\right)=\Phi(-\beta)

Where :math:`\beta` is the so called Cornell reliability index, named after
Cornell (1969), and is equal to the number of the standard derivation
:math:`\sigma_M` by which the mean values :math:`\mu_M` of the safety margin
:math:`M` are zero. [Faber2009]_

.. figure:: images/f-02-08-a.*
   :alt: Safety Margin an Reliability Index
   :align: center
   :scale: 50


Hasofer and Lind Reliability Index
----------------------------------

The reliability index can be interpreted as a measure of the distance to the
failure surface, as shown in the Figure above. In the one dimensional case the
standard deviation of the safety margin was used as scale. To obtain a similar
scale in the case of more basic variables, Hasofer and Lind (1974) proposed a
non-homogeneous linear mapping of a set of random variables :math:`{\bf X}`
from a physical space into a set of normalized and uncorrelated random
variables :math:`{\bf Z}` in a normalized space. [Madsen2006]_

.. note::
   [Hasofer and Lind Reliability Index]

   The Hasofer and Lind reliability index, denoted by :math:`\beta_{HL}`, is
   the shortest distance :math:`{\bf z}^*` from the origin to the failure
   surface :math:`g({\bf Z})` in a normalized space.

   .. math::
      :label: eq:2_78

              \beta_{HL}:=\beta={\vec\alpha}^T{\bf z}^*

The shortest distance to the failure surface :math:`{\bf z}^*` is also known
as design point and :math:`{\vec \alpha}` denotes the normal vector to the
failure surface :math:`g({\bf Z})` and is given by

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_79

           {\vec\alpha} = - \frac{\nabla g({\bf z}^*)}{|\nabla g({\bf z}^*)|}

where :math:`g({\bf z})` is the gradient vector, which is assumed to exist:
[Madsen2006]_

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_80

           \nabla g({\bf z}) = \left (\frac{\partial g}{\partial z_1}({\bf
           z}),\ldots, \frac{\partial g}{\partial z_n}({\bf z})\right)

Finding the reliability index :math:`\beta` is therefore an optimization
problem

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_81

           \min_x \, |{\bf z}|\,: \, g({\bf z})=0

The calculation of :math:`\beta` can be undertaken in a number of different
ways. In the general case where the failure surface is non-linear, an
iterative method must be used. [Thoft-Christensen]_

Probability Transformation
==========================

Due to the reliability index :math:`\beta_{HL}` , being only defined in a
normalized space, the basic random variables :math:`\bf X` have to be
transformed into standard normal random variables :math:`\bf Z`. Additionally,
the basic random variables :math:`\bf Z` can be correlated and those
relationships should also be transformed. 

Transformation of Dependent Random Variables using Nataf Approach
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One method to handle this is using the Nataf joint distribution model, if the
marginal cdfs are known. [Baker2010]_ The correlated random variables
:math:`{\bf X} = ( X_1 , \dots , X_n )` with the correlation matrix :math:`\bf
R` can be transformed by

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_82

           y_i=\Phi^{-1}\left(F_{X_{i}}(x_i)\right) \qquad i = 1,\dots,n

into normally distributed random variables :math:`\bf Y` with zero means and
unit variance, but still correlated with :math:`{\bf R}_0` . Nataf’s
distribution for :math:`\bf X` is obtained by assuming that :math:`\bf Y` is
jointly normal. [Liu1986]_

The correlation coefficients for :math:`\bf X` and :math:`\bf Y` are related by

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_83

           \rho_{X_i,X_j} =
           \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}
           \left(\frac{x_i-\mu_{X_i}}{\sigma_{X_i}}\right)
           \left(\frac{x_j-\mu_{X_j}}{\sigma_{X_j}}\right)
           \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{1-\rho_{Y_i,Y_j}^2}}
           \exp\left(-\frac{y_i^2-2\rho_{Y_i,Y_j}y_iy_j+y_j^2}{2(1-\rho_{Y_i,Y_j}^2)}\right) d z_i d z_j

Once this is done, the transformation from the correlated normal random
variables :math:`\bf Y` to uncorrelated normal random variables :math:`\bf Z`
is addressed. Hence, the transformation is

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_84

           {\bf z}={\bf L}_0^{-1}{\bf y} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad {\bf y} =
           {\bf L}_0{\bf z}

where :math:`\bf L` is the Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix
:math:`\bf R` of :math:`\bf Y`. The Jacobian matrix, denoted by :math:`\bf J`,
for the transformation is given by

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_85

           {\bf J}_{ZX} = \frac{\partial {\bf z}}{\partial {\bf x}} = {\bf
           L}_0^{-1}\text{diag} \left(\frac{f_{X_i}(x_i)}{\Phi (z_i)}\right)

This approach is useful when the marginal distribution for the random
variables :math:`\bf X` is known and the knowledge about the variables
dependence is limited to correlation coefficients. [Baker2010]_

Transformation of Dependent Random Variables using Rosenblatt Approach
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An alternative to the Nataf approach is to consider the joint pdf of
:math:`\bf X` as a product of conditional pdfs.

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_86

           f_{{\bf X}}({\bf x}) = f_{X_1}(x_1) f_{X_2|X_1}(x_2|x_1) \dots
           f_{X_n|X_1,\dots,X_{n-1}}(x_n|x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})

As a result of the sequential conditioning in the pdf, the conditional cdfs
are given for :math:`i \in [1,n]`

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_87

           F_{X_i|X_1,\dots,X_{i-1}}(x_i|x_1,\dots,x_{i-1}) =
           \int_{-\infty}^{x_i}
           f_{X_i|X_1,\dots,X_{i-1}}(x_i|x_1,\dots,x_{i-1}) d x_i

These conditional distributions for the random variables :math:`\bf X` can be
transformed into standard normal marginal distributions for the variables
:math:`\bf Z`, using the so called Rosenblatt transformation
[Rosenblatt1952]_, suggested by Hohenbichler and Rackwitz (1981).

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_88

           \begin{split}
           z_1 &= \Phi^{-1}\left( F_{X_1}(x_1) \right)\\
           z_2 &= \Phi^{-1}\left( F_{X_2|X_1}(x_2|x_1) \right)\\
           &\vdots\\
           z_n &= \Phi^{-1}\left(
           F_{X_n|X_1,\dots,X_{n-1}}(x_n|x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}) \right)
           \end{split}

The Jacobian of this transformation is a lower triangular matrix having the
elements [Baker2010]

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_89

           \left[{\bf J}_{ZX}\right]_{i,j} = \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial x_j} = 
           \begin{cases}\displaystyle
           \frac{1}{\Phi(u_i)}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}
           F_{X_i|X_1,\dots,X_{i-1}}(x_i|x_1,\dots,x_{i-1}) & i \geq j\\
           0 & i < j
           \end{cases}

In some cases the Rosenblatt transformation cannot be applied, because the
required conditional pdfs cannot be provided. In this case other
transformations may be useful, for example Nataf transformation.

First-Order Reliability Method (FORM)
=====================================

Let :math:`\bf Z` be a set of uncorrelated and standardized normally distributed random
variables :math:`( Z_1 ,\dots, Z_n )` in the normalized z-space, corresponding
to any set of random variables :math:`{\bf X} = ( X_1 , \dots , X_n )` in the
physical x-space, then the limit state surface in x-space is also mapped on
the corresponding limit state surface in z-space.

According to Definition :eq:`eq:2_78`, the reliability index :math:`\beta` is
the minimum distance from the z-origin to the failure surface. This distance
:math:`\beta` can directly be mapped to a probability of failure

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_90

           p_f \approx p_{f1} = \Phi(-\beta)

this corresponds to a linearization of the failure surface. The linearization point
is the design point :math:`{\bf z}^*`. This procedure is called First Order
Reliability Method (FORM) and :math:`\beta` is the First Order Reliability
Index. [Madsen2006]_

:math:`g({\bf X}) = 0` the failure surface.

.. figure:: images/f-02-09-b.*
   :alt: FORM b
   :align: center
   :scale: 50

After
transformation in the normalized space, the random variables :math:`{\bf X}`
are now uncorrelated and standardized normally distributed, also the failure
surface is transformed into :math:`g({\bf Z}) = 0`.

.. figure:: images/f-02-09-c.*
   :alt: FORM c
   :align: center
   :scale: 50

FORM corresponds to a linearization of the failure surface :math:`g({\bf Z}) =
0`. Performing this method, the design point :math:`{\bf z}^*` and the
reliability index :math:`\beta` can be computed.


Second-Order Reliability Method (SORM)
======================================

Better results can be obtained by higher order approximations of the failure
surface. The Second Order Reliability Method (SORM) uses; for example, a
quadratic approximation of the failure surface. [Baker2010]_


Simulation Methods
==================

The preceding sections describe some methods for determining the reliability
index :math:`\beta` for some common forms of the limit state
function. However, it is sometimes extremely difficult or impossible to find
:math:`\beta`. [Nowak2000]_

In this case, Equation :eq:`eq:2_70` may also be
estimated by numerical simulation methods. A large variety of simulation
techniques can be found in the literature, indeed, the most commonly used
method is the Monte Carlo method. [Faber2009]_

The principle of simulation methods is to carry out random sampling in the
physical (or standardized) space. For each of the samples the limit state
function is evaluated to figure out, whether the configuration is desired or
undesired. The probability of failure :math:`p_f` is estimated by the number
of undesired configurations, respected to the total numbers of
samples. [Lemaire2010]_

For this analysis Equation :eq:`eq:2_70` can be rewritten as

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_91

           p_f = P(g({\bf X})\leq 0) = \iiint\limits_{g({\bf X})\leq 0}
           I(g({\bf X})\leq 0) f_{{\bf X}}({\bf x}) d {\bf x}

where :math:`I` is an indicator function that is equals to 1 if :math:`g({\bf
X}) \leq 0` and otherwise 0. Equation :eq:`eq:2_91` can be interpreted as
expected value of the indicator function. Therefore, the probability of
failure can be estimated such as [Malioka2009]_

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_92

           \tilde{p}_f = \text{Ex}\left[I(g({\bf X})\leq 0)\right] =
           \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} I(g({\bf X})\leq 0)

Crude Monte Carlo Simulation
============================

The Crude Monte Carlo simulation (CMC) is the most simple form and corresponds
to a direct application of Equation :eq:`eq:2_92`. A large number :math:`n` of
samples are simulated for the set of random variables :math:`\bf X`. All
samples that lead to a failure are counted :math:`n_f` and after all
simulations the probability of failure :math:`p_f` may be estimated by
[Faber2009]_

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_93

           \tilde{p}_f = \frac{n_f}{n}

Theoretically, an infinite number of simulations will provide an exact
probability of failure. However, time and the power of computers are limited;
therefore, a suitable amount of simulations :math:`n` are required to achieve
an acceptable level of accuracy. One possibility to reach such a level is to
limit the coefficient of variation CoV for the probability of
failure. [Lemaire2010]_

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_94

           \text{CoV} = \sqrt{\frac{1-p_f}{n p_f}} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{n
           p_f}} \qquad \text{for} \quad p_f \to 0

Importance Sampling
===================

To decrease the number of simulations and the coefficient of variation, other
methods can be performed. One commonly applied method is the Importance
Sampling simulation method (IS). Here the prior information about the failure
surface is added to Equation :eq:`eq:2_91`

.. math::
   :label: eq:2_95

           p_f = P(g({\bf X})\leq 0) = \iiint\limits_{g({\bf X})\leq 0}
           I(g({\bf X})\leq 0) \frac{f_{{\bf X}}({\bf x})}{h_{{\bf X}}({\bf
           x})} h_{{\bf X}}({\bf x}) d {\bf x}

where :math:`h_{X} ({\bf X})` is the importance sampling probability
density function of :math:`\bf X`. Consequently Equation :eq:`eq:2_92` is
extended to [Faber2009]_

.. math::
  :label: eq:2_96

          \tilde{p}_f = \text{Ex}\left[I(g({\bf X})\leq 0) \frac{f_{{\bf
          X}}({\bf x})}{h_{{\bf X}}({\bf x})}\right] =
          \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} I(g({\bf X})\leq 0)\frac{f_{{\bf X}}({\bf
          x})}{h_{{\bf X}}({\bf x})}

The key to this approach is to choose :math:`h_{X} ({\bf X})` so that samples
are obtained more frequently from the failure domain. For this reason, often a
FORM (or SORM) analysis is performed to find a prior design point. [Baker2010]

the failure domain can be observed.
